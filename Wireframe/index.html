        <h2>What is a README File and why it is important</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is a text file that serves as a guide for users of a project, 
          providing essential information about its purpose, installation, and usage. 
          It is typically the first document a user encounters when accessing a project, 
          making it crucial for effective communication and collaboration.
